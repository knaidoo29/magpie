Regarding uploading to pypi and conda.

Pypi upload
-----------

If you don't already have twine:

    python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine

To upload your package first get rid of existing builds:

    rm -r build
    rm -r dist
    rm -r magpie_pkg.egg-info

To build and install portable versions for pip (there might be some redundant lines
here but its working)

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

    python -m twine check dist/*

    python -m twine upload dist/*

Pypi username and password are requested for the last step.

conda upload
------------

To start this you need to create the files in conda-recipe, i.e. meta.yaml, build.sh
and bld.bat. Once these are done (look here for info on this:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html)

Build the conda version inside the root directory for magpie:

    conda-build conda-recipe

This can take a while as it sets up the entire environment and dependencies from
scratch, it doesn't work from your existing python environment. Pay attention to
the <long-magpie-conda-install>.tar.bz2 file that is produced as we will need this
later.

First login to your anaconda account.

    anaconda login

And then upload with the following and alter the <> to the real file name.

    anaconda upload <long-magpie-conda-install>.tar.bz2
